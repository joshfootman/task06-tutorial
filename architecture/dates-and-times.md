# Dates and Times

Handling dates, times, and timezones is a common requirement in many applications, from displaying timestamps to scheduling events or performing complex temporal calculations. Dealing with these concepts accurately can be surprisingly complex due to variations in formats, timezones, and calendar systems. This section outlines the tools we use in Task06 to manage all our date and time related operations reliably.

## dayjs

For most of our day-to-day date and time manipulation, formatting, and parsing needs in Task06, we use the Day.js library. Day.js is a minimalist JavaScript library that parses, validates, manipulates, and displays dates and times. It's designed to be lightweight and has a simple, familiar API (similar to Moment.js, but much smaller), making it efficient and easy to work with for common tasks like displaying dates in different formats, adding or subtracting time, and comparing dates.
