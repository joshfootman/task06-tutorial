# Parsing

In any application that interacts with external data sources, such as APIs, there's a fundamental need to ensure that the data we receive is in the format and structure we expect. Data fetched from a server cannot always be guaranteed to be perfectly structured or complete. Parsing is the process of taking this raw, incoming data and validating it against a defined schema, transforming it if necessary, to ensure it conforms to the shape our application requires. This critical step helps prevent runtime errors, improves data integrity, and makes our application more robust against unexpected data variations.

To effectively handle the parsing and validation of our fetched data in Task06, we utilize the Zod library. Zod is a TypeScript-first schema declaration and validation library. It allows us to define the expected shape (schema) of our data with clear and concise syntax. Once a schema is defined, Zod can then parse incoming data, throwing detailed errors if the data doesn't match the schema, or returning a strongly-typed, validated object if it does. Using Zod provides us with confidence in the data our application is working with and integrates seamlessly with TypeScript to offer end-to-end type safety from the API response to where the data is used in our components.
