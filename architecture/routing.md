# Routing

In a single-page application (SPA) like Task06, the browser doesn't perform a full page reload when the user navigates to different views or sections. Instead, Routing is the mechanism that allows us to display different components and content based on the URL in the browser's address bar. It manages the application's navigation flow, enabling users to move between different "pages" or screens seamlessly without disrupting the overall application state. Understanding how routing works is fundamental to building a multi-page user experience within our SPA.

To implement the routing functionality in Task06, we use React Router, the standard library for routing in React applications. React Router allows us to declaratively define the different paths (URLs) in our application and map them to specific components that should be rendered when that path is active. It handles browser history, URL parameters, navigation links, and protected routes, providing all the tools needed to create a dynamic and intuitive navigation experience for our users. This section will cover how to set up and use React Router to define the navigation structure of our application.
