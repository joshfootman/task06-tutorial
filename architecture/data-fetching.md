# Data fetching

A crucial part of any web application is fetching data from a server to display to the user and enable dynamic interactions. In Task06, we manage this entire process using TanStack Query. This powerful library provides a robust and efficient way to handle fetching, caching, synchronizing, and updating asynchronous data, making our application more performant and significantly simplifying state management related to server interactions. This section will detail how we utilize TanStack Query to handle all our data fetching needs.

TanStack Query is the cornerstone of our data fetching strategy in Task06. It's a powerful library dedicated to managing asynchronous operations, often referred to as "server state." Instead of manually handling loading states, errors, caching, and background updates for every data request, TanStack Query provides intelligent hooks and utilities that abstract away these complexities. It handles fetching data, keeps it fresh, and ensures our UI is always in sync with the server, leading to a more reliable, performant, and enjoyable developer experience. This section will guide you through setting up and effectively using TanStack Query throughout the application.
