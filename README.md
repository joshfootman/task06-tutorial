This repository is for learning the technologies used within the Task 6 application. The goal here is for you to learn about the libraries used within the UI and give you a chance to get your hands dirty.

## Data Structure

### Entities

There are four types of entities:
- Research Project (triangle): A high-level study that a University sector conducts to advance knowledge in a particular field.
- Laboratory (circle): Those facilities, equipment, or tools that support the conduct of Research Projects, either directly or indirectly.
- Researcher (square): A private or public sector individual, company, or business that owns, operates, maintains, or supplies a Laboratory.
- Institution (diamond): Institution where Laboratory or Researcher is affiliated with.

### Relationships

The following explains the relationship structure:
- Research Projects belong to Departments
- Laboratories belong to Departments
- Researchers belong to Departments
- Research Projects can support Research Projects within the same Department
- Laboratories can support Research Projects within the same Department
- Laboratories can have dependencies, redundancies, or be sub-laboratories of other Laboratories within the same Department
- Laboratories can have relationships with Laboratories from other Departments (e.g., sharing resources, collaborating on Research Projects)
- Researchers can own, operate, supply, or maintain Laboratories
- Research Projects and Laboratories can be affiliated with Institutions

## /graphql
